# Rocket.chat integrated with WhatsApp

![](media/demo.gif)

This service sits between [Rocket.chat](rocket.chat) and [chat-api](chat-api.com).
The goal of this project is to be able to integrate rocket chat and whatsapp seamlessly;
allowing both whatsapp users and rocket.chat users to share images, audio, video and text.
This solution is helpful for companies looking for centralizing their customer support, as
it is very commom to have both a chat widget on the company's website, and users who prefer
to use whatsapp as a customer support channel.

## What this project is not.
This project is not related to an official WhatsApp message broker, nor do I or anyone involved
in this project offer any official message broker service.
